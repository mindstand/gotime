# gotime
It's gotime

## But... Why?
GoLang does not have native Time, Date, LocalTime, LocalDate, or LocalDateTime types.
This package includes some stand-in replacements.

**Note that for now, gotime will not fully implement time.Time's functionality. You can get the base time by calling the `.GetTime()` function**
